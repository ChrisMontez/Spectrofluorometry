# Fluorescein Content in a Disodium Phosphate Buffer

##  Objective
The objective of this experiment was to determine the concentration of fluorescein dissolved in a 0.05M Disodium Phosphate Buffer. 
All data-collection efforts were performed in the Instrumentation Lab at the University of the Incarnate Word. The visualizations in this repository were created using Seaborn. Regression analysis  of the calibration curve was performed using scikit-learn.

## Conclusion

Spectrofluorometric analysis was performed on a sample containing an unknown concentration of fluorescein in a 0.05 M disodium phosphate buffer. A linear regression model was created using seven fluorescein/buffer solutions of known concentration and the Scikit-Learn Python library. The resulting R-Squared value of the regression model was **0.996**. The concentration of fluorescein in the unknown sample was determined to be **0.004 Î¼mol**.
